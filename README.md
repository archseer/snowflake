# Introduction
Herein lies a [NixOS][NixOS] configuration template using the new [flakes][wiki]
mechanism. Its aim is to provide a generic repository which neatly separates
concerns and allows one to get up and running with NixOS faster than ever, while
keeping your code clean and organized.

Some key advantages include:
* A single home for all your Nix expressions, easily sharable and portable!
* Skip the setup, simply use the included [nix-shell](./shell.nix) or
  [direnv][direnv] profile and get up and running with flakes right away.
* Thanks to flakes, the entire system is more [deterministic](./flake.lock).
* Systems defined under [hosts](./hosts) are automatically imported into
  `nixosConfigurations`, ready to deploy.
* [Profiles](./profiles/list.nix) are a simple mechanism for using portable
  code across machines, and are available to share via the
  `nixosModules.profiles` output.
* Defined [packages](./pkgs/default.nix) and
  [modules](./modules/list.nix), are automatically wired and available from
  anywhere. They are _also_ sharable via their respective flake outputs.
* Easily [override](./pkgs/override.nix) packages from different nixpkgs versions.
* Keep [user](./users) configuration isolated and easily reusable by taking
  advantage of [user profiles](./users/profiles) and [home-manager][home-manager].
* [Overlay](./overlays) files are automatically available and sharable.

For a more detailed explanation of the code structure, check out the
[docs](./DOC.md).

### âš  Advisory
Flakes are still new, so not everything works yet. However, it has been to
merged in [nixpkgs][nixpkgs] via [`pkgs.nixFlakes`][nixFlakes]. Thus, this
project should be considered _experimental_, until flakes become the default.

Also, flakes are meant to deprecate nix-channels. It's recommend not to install
any. If your really want them, they should work if you hook them into
`NIX_PATH`.

# Setup
There are many way to get up and running. You can fork this repo or use it as
a template. There is a [bare branch][bare] if you want to start with a
completely empty template and make your own profiles from scratch.

You'll need to have NixOS already installed since the `nixos-install` script
doesn't yet support flakes.

If you already have [nix-command][nix-command] setup you can:
```
# for standard template
nix flake new -t "github:nrdxp/nixflk" flk

# for bare template
nix flake new -t "github:nrdxp/nixflk/bare" flk
```

However you decide to acquire the repo, once you have it, you'll want to __move
or symlink__ it to `/etc/nixos` for ease of use. Once inside:

```
nix-shell # or `direnv allow` if you prefer
```

From here it's up to you. You can deploy the barebones [NixOS](./hosts/NixOS.nix)
host and build from there, or you can copy your existing `configuration.nix`.
You'll probably at least need to setup your `fileSystems` and make sure the
[locale](./local/locale.nix) is correct.

Once you're ready to deploy you can use `nixos-rebuild` if your NixOS version
is recent enough to support flakes, _or_ the [shell.nix](./shell.nix) defines
its own `rebuild` command in case you need it.

```
# Usage: rebuild host {switch|boot|test|iso}
rebuild <host-filename> test
```

## Build an ISO

You can make an ISO and customize it by modifying the [niximg](./hosts/niximg.nix)
file:

```sh
rebuild iso
```
